Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The goal of run_analysis.R is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis.

The data used in the project relates to wearable computing; data collected from accelerometers from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

run_analysis.R will:

1. Obtain wearable computing data downloaded from and external source.
2. Merge training and test sets to create one data set.
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Use descriptive activity names for each activitity in the data set
5. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
6. Create a new, independent tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
